Netflix Clone

The front-end of this app was created with ReactJS along with Tailwind to create an app that looks as similar to Netlix as possible. Here is a list of the important features of this project:

  - I used the Movie DB API to populate the site with up to date film data.
  - I used Tailwind CSS to style the project which I find to be much more efficient than using vanilla CSS.
  - Firebase was used for the backend which stores user log in data as well as any profiles that they have created.
  - Redux handles the logging in and out for the user which is a great way to handle this interaction whilst keeping the required code to a minimum.

All of my projects are built mobile first and then resized for larger screens as rfom my experience, this is the most seemless way to handle responsive design.
